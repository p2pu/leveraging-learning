**What?** While school records are a dominant way of documenting learning, most learning does not happen in school. In this learning circle, you will learn strategies for identifying, evaluating, and documenting the learning that you have gained beyond school. 

**Why?** At the end of this learning circle, you will be better prepared for job interviews and/or for conversations with your current employer about your strengths. In addition, if you wish to complete a bachelor’s degree, you will have earned credit toward your degree at [College Unbound](https://www.collegeunbound.org).

**For whom?** This learning circle will be most helpful for those embarking upon a job search and those looking to return to school to earn a Bachelor’s degree.

**How?** Over the course of eight weeks, we will 
* Apply strategies for self-discovery and self-assessment to identify and describe learning gained from life experiences.
* Analyze and articulate the skills, knowledge, capacities gained from these experiences as well as their impact.
* Align these skills, knowledge, capacities, and impact with high-level professional and academic competencies.
* Organize and present the results of this articulation and alignment in a portfolio.
* Plan for future development of your learning.
